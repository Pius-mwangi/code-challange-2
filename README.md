# Speed Limit Checker

This JavaScript code prompts the user to input the speed of a car and checks if it exceeds the speed limit. It then calculates the number of demerit points accumulated and determines if the driver's license should be suspended based on a demerit point threshold.

## Usage

1. Open the JavaScript code in your preferred development environment or browser console.
2. Run the code.
3. Enter the speed of the car when prompted.
4. The program will output one of the following:

   - If the car speed is within the limit: "OK"
   - If the car speed exceeds the limit: The number of demerit points accumulated
   - If the demerit points exceed the threshold: "License suspended"
